	abstract = {Diagnostic testing can be used to discriminate subjects with a target disorder from subjects without it. Several indicators of diagnostic performance have been proposed, such as sensitivity and speciﬁcity. Using paired indicators can be a disadvantage in comparing the performance of competing tests, especially if one test does not outperform the other on both indicators. Here we propose the use of the odds ratio as a single indicator of diagnostic performance. The diagnostic odds ratio is closely linked to existing indicators, it facilitates formal meta-analysis of studies on diagnostic test performance, and it is derived from logistic models, which allow for the inclusion of additional variables to correct for heterogeneity. A disadvantage is the impossibility of weighing the true positive and false positive rate separately. In this article the application of the diagnostic odds ratio in test evaluation is illustrated.

The usual method of comparing responders and nonresponders is biased in favor of responders, and these results are frequently misinterpreted as providing evidence that response prolongs survival, or that the treatment under study is effective. Two valid methods for comparing responders and nonresponders are discussed and recommendations are made concerning the analysis of survival by response. A comparison of survival by response category may be useful descriptively, but such a comparison should not be used for inference concerning treatment effectiveness.},
