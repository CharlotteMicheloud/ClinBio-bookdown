	abstract = {Recent FDA guidance on adaptive clinical trial designs defines bias as “a systematic tendency for the estimate of treatment effect to deviate from its true value,” and states that it is desirable to obtain and report estimates of treatment effects that reduce or remove this bias. The conventional end‐of‐trial point estimates of the treatment effects are prone to bias in many adaptive designs, because they do not take into account the potential and realized trial adaptations. While much of the methodological developments on adaptive designs have tended to focus on control of type I error rates and power considerations, in contrast the question of biased estimation has received relatively less attention. This article is the first in a two‐part series that studies the issue of potential bias in point estimation for adaptive trials. Part I provides a comprehensive review of the methods to remove or reduce the potential bias in point estimation of treatment effects for adaptive designs, while part II illustrates how to implement these in practice and proposes a set of guidelines for trial statisticians. The methods reviewed in this article can be broadly classified into unbiased and bias‐reduced estimation, and we also provide a classification of estimators by the type of adaptive design. We compare the proposed methods, highlight available software and code, and discuss potential methodological gaps in the literature.},

	abstract = {Regulatory guidance notes the need for caution in the interpretation of confidence intervals (CIs) constructed during and after an adaptive clinical trial. Conventional CIs of the treatment effects are prone to undercoverage (as well as other undesirable properties) in many adaptive designs, because they do not take into account the potential and realised trial adaptations. This paper is the first in a two-part series that explores CIs for adaptive trials. It provides a comprehensive review of the methods to construct CIs for adaptive designs, while the second paper illustrates how to implement these in practice and proposes a set of guidelines for trial statisticians. We describe several classes of techniques for constructing CIs for adaptive clinical trials, before providing a systematic literature review of available methods, classified by the type of adaptive design. As part of this, we assess, through a proposed traffic light system, which of several desirable features of CIs (such as achieving nominal coverage and consistency with the hypothesis test decision) each of these methods holds.},

	abstract = {Diagnostic testing can be used to discriminate subjects with a target disorder from subjects without it. Several indicators of diagnostic performance have been proposed, such as sensitivity and speciﬁcity. Using paired indicators can be a disadvantage in comparing the performance of competing tests, especially if one test does not outperform the other on both indicators. Here we propose the use of the odds ratio as a single indicator of diagnostic performance. The diagnostic odds ratio is closely linked to existing indicators, it facilitates formal meta-analysis of studies on diagnostic test performance, and it is derived from logistic models, which allow for the inclusion of additional variables to correct for heterogeneity. A disadvantage is the impossibility of weighing the true positive and false positive rate separately. In this article the application of the diagnostic odds ratio in test evaluation is illustrated.

  Abstract                 = {The common practice of comparing the survival of responders and nonresponders when reporting the results of cancer chemotherapy treatment is investigated. The usual method of comparing responders and nonresponders is biased in favor of responders, and these results are frequently misinterpreted as providing evidence that response prolongs survival, or that the treatment under study is effective. Two valid methods for comparing responders and nonresponders are discussed and recommendations are made concerning the analysis of survival by response. A comparison of survival by response category may be useful descriptively, but such a comparison should not be used for inference concerning treatment effectiveness.},
